As the van slowed unexpectedly because of roadworks, the motorcyclist behind failed to reduce speed, resulting in a rear-end collision. The motorcyclist sustained minor injuries and was treated on-site by emergency responders. The incident caused temporary lane closures and substantial traffic delays. Investigators gathered CCTV footage and eyewitness statements to clarify the circumstances. This event highlighted the dangers of inattentiveness under changing road conditions, emphasizing the need for caution during construction zones.'
